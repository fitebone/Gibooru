# Gibooru
A python package that asynchronously *gibs* you access to many booru site APIs. Currently supports Danbooru and Gelbooru.

### Planned Features
* **New Boorus**: Rule34, yandere, sankaku, konachan, safebooru, lolibooru, furry
* HTTP/2 and QUIC (HTTP/3) support

### P.S.
This is a WIP if you couldn't already tell. Please email me with any questions or concerns.
*Heavily inspired and influenced by [pybooru](https://github.com/LuqueDaniel/pybooru) and its async WIP [pybooru](https://github.com/onirei/pybooru)*
